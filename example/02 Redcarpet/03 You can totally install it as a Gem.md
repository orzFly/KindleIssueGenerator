Redcarpet is readily available as a Ruby gem. It will build some native
extensions, but the parser is standalone and requires no installed libraries.

    $ [sudo] gem install redcarpet

The Redcarpet source (including Sundown as a submodule) is available at GitHub:

    $ git clone git://github.com/vmg/redcarpet.git
